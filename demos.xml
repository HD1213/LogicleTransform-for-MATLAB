   <description>The MATLAB implementation of the logicle transform is based on C/C++ and Java code by Wayne A. Moore and David R. Parks, which was released under the Revised Berkeley Software Distribution open source license for free use in cytometry software. The C/C++ and Java implementations may be found in the supporting information of "Update for the logicle data scale including operational code implementations" &lt;a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cyto.a.22030/abstract"&gt;doi: 10.1002/cyto.a.22030&lt;/a&gt;.

I have developed this implementation in order to avoid the complication of using MATLAB MEX files to use the C/C++ implementation already available. The implementation provided here is easily modified and extended within MATLAB, and I encourage you to contribute if you feel that something is missing.</description>
